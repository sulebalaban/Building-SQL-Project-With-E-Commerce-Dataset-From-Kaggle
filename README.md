Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data using MySQL. The datasets, sourced from Kaggle and imported in Excel format, provide insights into customer behavior and business performance. 
Through a series of SQL queries, we perform customer segmentation, identify top customers, and analyze the most profitable states and cities. The goal is to help make data-driven decisions for business expansion and customer retention strategies.

RFM Model
The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model is used for customer segmentation. It categorizes customers based on:
Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase.
Frequency (F): How often a customer purchases.
Monetary (M): How much a customer spends.
This allows businesses to better understand customer behavior and target marketing strategies effectively.

Tools Used
MySQL: For data processing and queries.
Kaggle Datasets: Used Excel files for storing sales data.
